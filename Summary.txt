I faced a few challenges with this project, mostly in the translation from my initial design in Figma to HTML and CSS form. The bottom nav, scrolling bus time section, and certain spacing issues all became obstacles to overcome in their own way. Ultimately, I feel that the coded portion is an accurate realization of my design, with slight tweaks to clarify certain elements (such as changing ‘m’ to ‘min’ to avoid confusion between minutes and miles). There were several times where my code was broken and it took time for me to find out what the problems were. The bottom nav icons were initially .png icons and I figured out how to create .svg files so that they would be displayed clearly and without pixelation. Other than that, this was a fun project and an extremely educational exercise for me!
